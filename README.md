"""
Advantage of Averaging the Cost

1. Scaler independence: averaging ensures the cost function is independent of the dataset size. without averaging the cost would grow with number
data pts.

2. Simplified learning rate: averaging keeps the gradient value in range, which helps in tuning the learning rate and ensures stability during
gradient descent.

3. Numerical stability: averaging prevents the cost and gradient from becoming large, which could lead to numberical instability during computation.
